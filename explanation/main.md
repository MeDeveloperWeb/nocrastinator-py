# Main Module

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `main.py` file, which is the main entry point for the Productivity Tracker application. It ensures the necessary setup is complete and launches the application.

## Overview
The `main.py` file is responsible for starting the Productivity Tracker application. It checks that the required data directory exists and then launches the main application.

## Code Explanation

### Imports
```python
import os
import sys
from app import main
```
- **os**: Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as creating directories.
- **sys**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
- **from app import main**: Imports the `main` function from the `app` module, which starts the application.

### Main Entry Point
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Make sure the data directory exists
    from config import DATA_DIRECTORY
    os.makedirs(DATA_DIRECTORY, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Launch the application
    main()
```
- **if __name__ == "__main__":**: This line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module). If true, it executes the code block below.
- **from config import DATA_DIRECTORY**: Imports the `DATA_DIRECTORY` path from the `config` module.
- **os.makedirs(DATA_DIRECTORY, exist_ok=True)**: Ensures that the data directory exists. If it doesn't, this line creates it. The `exist_ok=True` parameter prevents an error if the directory already exists.
- **main()**: Calls the `main` function from the `app` module to start the application.

This document should help someone with basic Python knowledge understand the functionality and purpose of each part of the `main.py` file.

Next, I'll proceed with creating explanations for the `focus_score.py` and `pomodoro.py` files. Let me know if you want to continue with these or if there's anything specific you'd like to focus on.
